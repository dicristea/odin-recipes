        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When I lived in Korea I learned the secret to making good tteokbokki from a famous place in a local market. It was run by an old lady who could always be found stirring her pot of tteokbokki, and there were always people lined up to buy it.</p>

        <p>She was cooking right in front of us to I saw she used dried anchovies in her stock. That ingredient made a huge difference in the flavor, so I started using it when I made my tteokbokki at home. I once ran out of dried anchovies and made tteokbokki without it, and it didn’t taste at all like what I was expecting. So don’t forget to always make a good stock with dried anchovies when you make this! It totally makes this dish!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound rice cake</li>
