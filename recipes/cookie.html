        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are a few secrets to the best classic, chewy chocolate chip cookies. Number one: Don’t use chips; instead, opt for a mix of milk or semisweet and dark chocolate chunks. The second is to let the dough rest overnight or longer for a more complex, toffee-like flavor. Lastly, use an ice cream scooper to get even-sized cookies every time. And that’s it! With these little tweaks, the result is a cookie that’s textured on the outside, and soft and gooey on the inside. Absolutely perfect!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, <em>melted</em></li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>4 oz semi-sweet or milk chocolate chunks</li>
            <li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk, or your preference</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong><em>Enjoy!</em></strong></p>
